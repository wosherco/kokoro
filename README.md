## What is Kokoro?

Kokoro is a centralised place for all your data, for any AI. Kokoro gathers and syncs your data from your existing services, centralises it in a easy to understand format for AIs, and exposes this data through different APIs and MCPs to any AI or developer. But it doesn't stop there, Kokoro can also mutate your data on your behalf, from creating a Issue on Linear to deleting a Google Calendar event.

## How does it work?

Anything in Kokoro's brain (our fancy word for database) is called a **memory**. These memories are the main point of the centralization. There are different types of memories:

- Events
- Tasks

And coming pretty soon:

- Emails
- Messages
- Knowledge Base
- _and more..._

Kokoro also keeps track of people. That means that Kokoro will recognize the same people across memories, and provide better suggestions.
