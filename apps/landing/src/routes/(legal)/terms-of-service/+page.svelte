<h1>Kokoro — Terms of Service</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: 12 May 2025</em></p>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Kokoro</strong> (“<strong>Service</strong>”, “we”, “our”, “us”).  
By creating an account or accessing the Service, <strong>you agree to these Terms</strong>.  
If you do not agree, do not use Kokoro.</p>

<h2>1. Who may use the Service</h2>
<ul>

  <li><strong>Account.</strong> You are responsible for the security of your account and all activity that occurs under it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. The Service in a nutshell</h2>
<p>Kokoro lets you <strong>connect external platforms</strong> (e.g., Google Calendar, Linear) and exposes the aggregated data via:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Developer API</strong></li>
  <li><strong>MCP (Multimodal Control Panel)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A self‑hosted, <strong>non‑commercial edition</strong> is available under a separate source‑available licence.  
The hosted <strong>SaaS edition</strong> is € 6 / month, billed by Stripe.</p>

<h2>3. Subscriptions, billing &amp; refunds</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Free trial.</strong> We may offer time‑limited free trials at our discretion.</li>
  <li><strong>Billing.</strong> Fees are charged in advance via <strong>Stripe</strong>. Taxes are added where required.</li>
  <li><strong>EU 14‑day withdrawal.</strong> EU consumers may cancel within 14 days of first purchase for a full refund unless you have already started using paid features (§103 m Spanish RDL 1/2007).</li>
  <li><strong>Cancellation.</strong> Cancel anytime in the dashboard; service remains active until the end of the current billing period.</li>
  <li><strong>Deletion.</strong> On cancellation we delete your hosted data <strong>within 30 days</strong> (see §9).</li>

  <li>Repackage or resell the Service without our written permission.</li>
  <li>Attempt to bypass usage limits or abuse free tiers.</li>

  <li><strong>Our content &amp; software.</strong> We (or our licensors) own all rights in Kokoro, except for open‑source components listed in <code>OPEN_SOURCE.md</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Disclaimers &amp; limitation of liability</h2>
<p>The Service is provided <strong>“as is” and “as available.”</strong><br>
To the maximum extent permitted by law we disclaim all warranties (express or implied).<br>

</ul>

<h2>10. Governing law &amp; venue</h2>

Any dispute will be resolved exclusively by the courts of <strong>Madrid, Spain</strong>, unless consumer‑protection rules give you the right to sue in your EU country of residence.</p>
