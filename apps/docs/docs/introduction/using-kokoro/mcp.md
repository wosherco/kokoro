Kokoro MCP allows **any AI** to interact with Kokoro. This basically means that any AI will have access to your other platforms, and the capability of mutating them.

## How to use it?

It's pretty simple. Independent of what AI you're using, you'll first need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once installed, you'll have to login to the Kokoro MCP using the following command:

```bash
npx -y @kokoro.ws/mcp login
```

Just follow the instructions on the screen. Once done, follow the instructions for the AI you're using.

:::info
If you're self-hosting Kokoro, you'll have to run `npx -y @kokoro.ws/mcp host custom` to point the MCP to your server.
