## What is Kokoro?

Kokoro is a centralised place for all your data, for any AI. Kokoro gathers and syncs your data from your existing services, centralises it in a easy to understand format for AIs, and exposes this data through different APIs and MCPs to any AI or developer. But it doesn't stop there, Kokoro can also mutate your data on your behalf, from creating a Issue on Linear to deleting a Google Calendar event.

## How does it work?

Anything in Kokoro's brain (our fancy word for database) is called a **memory**. These memories are the main point of the centralization. There are different types of memories:

- Events
- Tasks

And coming pretty soon:

- Emails
- Messages
- Knowledge Base
- _and more..._

Kokoro also keeps track of people. That means that Kokoro will recognize the same people across memories, and provide better suggestions.

## Start using Kokoro

First of all, you'll need to choose your path.

Do you want us to **handle everything** for you, with **complete privacy**, with **0-setup required**? Choose the **Kokoro Cloud** option. It's just **$6/month**, and you can cancel at any time. **No hidden fees**.

Do you want to self-host Kokoro, and have full control over your data? Choose the **Kokoro Self-Hosted** option.
